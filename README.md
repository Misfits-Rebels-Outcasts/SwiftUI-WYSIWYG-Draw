# SwiftUI-WYSIWYG-Draw

This source code explores how to use SwiftUI for developing a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) vector drawing app. 

A WYSIWYG vector drawing app can be thought of as one that renders different objects such as a rectangle, an ellipse, a text, or other shapes on a canvas; 
the moving of objects around a canvas by dragging; and changing object properties by tapping on objects. 
This is illustrated in the screenshot of an iOS app below. 
Specifically, this article explores the use of a SwiftUI View as the "Drawing Canvas" instead of using a Core Graphics Canvas or a SwiftUI Canvas.
